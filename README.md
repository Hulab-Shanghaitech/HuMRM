# HuMRM

在HuMRM会议中：

任何人可以选择在会议中登台演讲，因为没有任何演讲顺序的表格安排。这不是大组会！这是非正式会谈。

任何人可以选择在被告知会议举行时间后参加/不参加会议，以及做演讲/不做演讲，且有权利不向任何人给出任何理由。eg 演讲到一半，因感到饥饿而直接退出会议。会议进行两小时后，xzc会提醒所有人会议已达两小时，可以离开。但是会议可能继续，可以在会议室继续讨论，也可以转战实验室/食堂/开封菜/……

演讲所需要的媒介（ppt/白板板书/纸质论文/……）可按照任何提出的要求进行保存。默认地，ppt将被保存在hulab的NAS中。如果你不希望你的ppt被这样保存，请在演讲完毕后在临时文件夹中删除你的ppt。

你可以线上参加这样的会议。我们会尽量为你保证你的演讲/听讲质量，但……总比不上线下参与，这不可避免。

你可以分享你最近的成果，包括但不限于用了什么设备/写了什么序列/炼了什么模型/跑了什么代码/……并展示你的结果。你的成果可以是失败。你可以展示失败的mapping图/糊成一团的主动脉图/跑不通的DL代码demo/……但是！你要讲明白你用什么、做了什么，以及你对它的分析。如果有人完全听不懂，你可能需要耐心些。

如果没有任何成果，也可以分享你最近读过的文章/提出你认为可能做的idea/提出任何你想提的问题/整理你的思路以判断接下来要做怎样的工作/晚饭想去哪吃什么/……。

开始演讲前，你可以准备ppt演示文稿，也可以只在会议室白板上比划，也可以什么媒介都不用。ppt可以没有模板，媒介可以是任何有质量的物体。

你完全可以使用任何语言进行发言（汉语普通话/英语/西班牙语/鱼人语/……）。

我们强烈希望听众能对演讲者发表严苛的评论，那会很有价值。

这是我们一部分hulab成员自发的非正式交流组织活动，力图达到组间技术交流、沟通合作的目的。理想地，我们希望每周都能找到两个小时的会议室时间，使用自己习惯的形式展示自己的想法或成果，由严厉的群友们狠狠拷打（bushi）。准确来说，HuMRM是我们尝试的第一步，是我们的怀疑与勇气共同的产物，可能很难坚持，说不定举办两次便草草收场。但只要有一个人坚持，我们就不会草草了事。形式主义从来被我们诟病，我们真诚地希望每个人都能从这必要的形式中建立有效的交流，收获有价值的思路与信息。

In HuMRM meetings:

Anyone may choose to take the stage at the meeting, as there is no tabular arrangement for any order of presentation. This is not a large group meeting! It is informal talks.

Anyone can choose to attend/not attend the meeting and give a talk/not give a talk after being told when the meeting will be held, and has the right to do so without giving any reason to anyone. eg Halfway through a talk, just drop out of the meeting because you feel hungry. After the meeting has been going on for two hours, xzc will remind everyone that the meeting has reached two hours and they can leave. But the meeting may continue, either in the meeting room to continue the discussion or move to the lab/cafeteria/open dish/......

The media required for the presentation (ppt/whiteboard slate/paper paper/......) can be saved according to any requirements presented. By default, the ppt will be saved in hulab's NAS. If you do not want your ppt to be saved this way, please delete your ppt in the temp folder after the presentation.

You can attend such sessions online. We will try to ensure the quality of your presentation/listening for you, but ...... is always better than offline participation, which is inevitable.

You can share your recent results, including but not limited to what equipment you used/what sequences you wrote/what models you refined/what code you ran/...... and show your results. Your results can be failures. You can show failed mapping diagrams/glued together aortic diagrams/running DL code demos that don't work/...... BUT! You have to explain what you used, what you did, and your analysis of it. You may need to be patient if someone is completely confused.

If nothing comes out of it, it's okay to share articles you've read recently/present an IDEA of what you think you might do/ask any questions you want to ask/organise your thoughts on what to do next/where you want to go for dinner and what to eat/.......

Before you start your presentation, you can prepare a PowerPoint presentation, or you can just gesture on the whiteboard in the meeting room, or you can use no medium at all. there can be no template for the PowerPoint, and the medium can be any object with mass.

You are completely free to speak in any language (Mandarin Chinese/English/Spanish/Fisherman/......).

We strongly hope that the audience will comment harshly on the speakers, that would be valuable.

This is a spontaneous and informal communication and organisation event for some of our hulab members, seeking to achieve inter-group technical exchange, communication and cooperation. Ideally, we would like to find two hours of meeting room time every week to present our ideas or results using the format we are accustomed to, and be severely tortured (bushi) by our stern groupmates. To be precise, HuMRM is the first step of our attempt, a product of our scepticism and courage together, it may be hard to stick to it, maybe hold it twice and end it hastily. But as long as one of us sticks to it, we won't be haphazard. Formalism has never been criticised by us, and we sincerely hope that everyone can establish effective communication and gain valuable ideas and information from this necessary form.
